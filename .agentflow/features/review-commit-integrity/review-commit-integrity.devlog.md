# STATUS

Project: OCP review-service improvement.

Notebook: .agentflow/features/review-commit-integrity/review-commit-integrity.devlog.md — stream.

Current commit: 8b35b4c581ac3d2f5f6669511eaa7b318310fc40 — accepted design; no source changes.

Tests/scenarios: design coverage inspected; tracker and whitespace checks passed; source diff empty; remote branch readback matched 2d5a68f; no runtime tests run.

Configuration: .agentflow/features/review-commit-integrity/ag.json — schema v7; codex. Root ag.json is untracked local bootstrap.

Proven: requirements, boundary discovery, Stage 1 design; external reports only changed declared files.

Open: Stage 1 implementation and validation; later-stage designs remain.

Next: red-first SHA-integrity implementation under approved Design Go, then independent security/acceptance checks.

Artifacts: .agentflow/features/review-commit-integrity/artifacts/A-001-review-service/design.md; .agentflow/features/review-commit-integrity/artifacts/A-001-review-service/tracker.md.

Archived eras: none.

Streams: none.

承接已確認範圍：將 OCP code-review 改造交由 agentflow 管理。三個階段為 SHA 正確性修復、四項量測與週報、相同 PR/SHA 的簡化流程實驗。先完成設計與第一階段；生產品質判讀與正式切換維持人工決策。既有隔離 worktree 已獲同意使用；不改動主 checkout 的既有修改。

## [RUN-001] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:50:23 (GPT-6/default)_

Route full_pipeline; allow-ag on; owner approved handoff. Dispatch requirements, codex-default, better, gpt-5.6-terra/high, external-runner-v1. Executable and ChatGPT login verified. Clone-only report authority; no production access. Root configuration remains local bootstrap; main checkout untouched.

## [RUN-002] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:53:19 (GPT-6/default)_

Requirements inspected and accepted with requirements-resolution.md corrections: human quality separate from integrity; two independent comparison arms; no new comparison DB. Matching report SHA/clone write scope verified. No product changes.

## [RUN-003] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:53:19 (GPT-6/default)_

Route full_pipeline; allow-ag on; owner approved handoff. Dispatch codewalk, codex-default, better, gpt-5.6-terra/high, external-runner-v1. Executable and ChatGPT login verified. Clone-only report authority; no production access. Root configuration remains local bootstrap; main checkout untouched.

## [RUN-004] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:57:19 (GPT-6/default)_

Codewalk accepted after source readback. Shared discovery coverage complete. Legacy outbox and finding-decision evidence included. Official GitHub commit_id contract verified. Explore/spike skipped with reasons in codewalk-resolution.md; security review required after implementation. Scope unchanged.

## [RUN-005] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:57:19 (GPT-6/default)_

Route full_pipeline; allow-ag on; owner approved handoff. Dispatch spec, codex-default, better, gpt-5.6-terra/high, external-runner-v1. Executable and ChatGPT login verified. Clone-only report authority; no production access. Root configuration remains local bootstrap; main checkout untouched.

## [RUN-006] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:59:15 (GPT-6/default)_

Checkpoint scope verified: changed paths only stream records/artifacts and local bootstrap ag.json. Requirements and codewalk complete; specification worker active. Tracker validated. No source edits, product tests, deployment, or GitHub review writes. Next inspect design and reach exact Design Go gate.

## [WIP-001] Checkpoint (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 11:59:15 (GPT-6/default)_

- **Finished:** Agentflow initialized in the existing isolated worktree; requirements and independent source-boundary discovery accepted.
- **Running now:** External specification worker prepares the smallest SHA-integrity patch design and scoped later stages.
- **Still to do:** Design acceptance and exact Design Go; implementation, tests/review, measurement and comparison follow later gates. No production work completed.
- **Next work action:** Read the specification and commit the concrete design.
- **Checks:** [x] tracker.md | [x] devlog RUN | [x] scope matches tracker

## [RUN-007] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 12:01:57 (GPT-6/default)_

Specification accepted with spec-resolution.md implementation clarification; canonical design.md copied byte-identically from worker report. T-1 complete. No workers remain. Source edits wait for exact Design Go; code tests and final security/acceptance remain unrun. Scope comparison confirms records/artifacts only.

## [RUN-008] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 12:02:46 (GPT-6/default)_

Design commit 8b35b4c581ac3d2f5f6669511eaa7b318310fc40. Tracker proof formatting corrected and revalidated; no design/source changes. Handoff awaits Design Go on that exact commit. Required skill instruction: Source work starts only after a later Design Go: <commit>. No implicit Design Go inferred from earlier generic approval.

> 是

Design Go: 8b35b4c581ac3d2f5f6669511eaa7b318310fc40 — approved by the owner in response to the exact design approval question.

## [RUN-009] Event (during round A-001)

* _2026-09-09 12:05:30 (GPT-6/default)_

Owner said 是 to the exact design-commit question. Design Go: 8b35b4c581ac3d2f5f6669511eaa7b318310fc40. Requirements/spec accepted earlier; source baseline unchanged. Begin Stage 1 only. Stage 2/3 and production rollout remain later work.
